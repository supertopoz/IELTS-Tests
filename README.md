# Progress-Check-Report-Builder
[This tool provides an example writing test for IELTS](https://supertopoz.github.io/IELTS-Tests/) that cannot be cheated on. When the test starts the screen goes for full screen. Once the test is completes the tool goes on to produce a Google document with the text formatted in the same way as it was in the text. 

# Life cycle

- Test is opened by user 
- User starts test
- If the user leaves the full screen the tests is aborted and their work converted to a Google document. 
- It the user saves their work the test leaves full screen and the their work is converted to a Google document.  

## Built With

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/your/project/tags). 

## Needed improvements

- Fix fonts depending on the programme as current font selector makes code very slow. 
- Make select buttons more pretty. 
- Add instructions on the tool on how to use it.
